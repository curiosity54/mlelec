molecular calculation with ethene to understand how the elements that are off by a phase for <c1 1s| c1 2p> (has the opposite sign compared to <c2 1s| c2 2p>). So why a model based on the atom-centered descriptor that must be identical for the two atoms is able to learn this? 
Does coupling somehow solve this problem?
